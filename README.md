# Battery Consumption Measurement Script

This MatLab script is used to measure the amount of current being drained by the mobile phone from the Agilent1 6632B high performance DC power supply. This script uses industry standard SCPI commands via the GPIB interface. Integration to the Matlab environment was done using the simplified VXI Plug&Play drivers.
